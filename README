Cave of Epokothar is a rogue-like role-playing game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rogue-like). There's a whole genre of these things, but I haven't found any written in JavaScript.

The objective is to explore, survive and accomplish the mission.

It is playable in webkit browsers using this link http://eballot.github.com/CaveOfEpokothar
